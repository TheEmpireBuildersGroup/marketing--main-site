**Technology has changed the way business works and holds a company's most valuable asset** - its DATA. Ten years ago, no one would think about buying Goldmine or Oracle without convening a committee to discuss the data, legal and infrastructure needs. They’d create a functional specification and have a multidisciplinary team analyze the process, implement, port the data and provide comprehensive training to the users.

Today, the average executive is **left on their own to poll LinkedIn for the best technology solution** for their specific problem. Then they stick their credit card number into the internet, buy a software as a service solution and ask the summer intern to set it up. Then, when it doesn’t work out, they **feel frustrated and end up paying tons of licensing fees** but managing the best they can using excel, wondering why it didn't work.

Business moves much faster in the digital age and people expect solutions to be in place very quickly. **Technology companies lead you to believe their system will meet a company's needs instantly and out of the box with little or no expert support.** Here, at The Empire Builders Group we find that most people have a day job to do and integrating a new piece of technology into the workflow of your business and making sure the information gets in there properly and continues to be put in there properly requires some careful attention.

Then they stick their credit card number into the internet, buy a software as a service and ask the summer intern to set it up. Then, when it doesn’t work out, they feel frustrated and overcharged in licensing and add-on fees for a system they aren't using because they've returned to a spreadsheet. No one can answer to why it didn't work.

Business moves much faster in the digital age and people expect solutions to be in place very quickly. Technology companies lead you to believe their system will meet a company's needs instantly and out of the box with little or no expert support. Here, at The Empire Builders Group we find that most people have a day job to do and integrating a new piece of technology into the workflow of your business and making sure the information flows in properly so it comes out into an effective dashboard requires some careful attention.
