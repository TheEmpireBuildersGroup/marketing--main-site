<p><h4><strong>What an Average Technology Implementation Looks Like Today:</strong></h4><br> 
<strong><li>Managed by - </strong>Businessperson with another main role or responsibility.<br> 
<strong><li>Sourcing Methodology - </strong>Poll LinkedIn, Google, colleagues, for solutions and best practices.<br> 
<strong><li>Implementation - </strong>Stick credit card number into internet form, send link to intern for setup.<br>  
<strong><li>Outcome - </strong>Necessary business intelligence doesn't magically appear on the fancy, built-in dashboard.<br> Feelings of anger and frustration over time and dollars wasted while Saturdays are spent reformatting the previous reporting spreadsheet.</li></p>  

<p><h4><strong>Why Does This Happen?</h4></strong><br>
Technology has changed the way business manages their most valuable asset - DATA. Ten years ago, no one would think about buying Goldmine or Oracle without convening a committee to discuss the data, legal and infrastructure needs. Theyâ€™d create a functional specification and have a multidisciplinary team analyze the process, implement, port the data and provide comprehensive training to the users. Today, business moves much faster and people expect solutions to be in place very quickly. Technology brands have capitalized on this and led you to believe their system will work instantly, out of the box with little or no expert support. You've probably already discovered that this isn't the case. </p>

<p><h4><strong>How Our Approach is Different</h4></strong><br>
Here, at The Empire Builders Group, we find that integrating a new piece of technology into the workflow of your business and making sure the information flows in properly so it comes out into an effective dashboard requires some careful attention. This is incredibly difficult to do when you have (another) day job and it's the first time you've seen this tool outside of it's packaging. We can help.
