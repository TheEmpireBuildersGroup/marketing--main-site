<p><h4><strong>What an Average Technology Implementation Looks Like Today:</strong></h4><br> 
<strong><li>Managed by - </strong>Businessperson with another main role or responsibility.<br> 
<strong><li>Sourcing Methodology - </strong>Poll LinkedIn, Google, colleagues, for solutions and best practices.<br> 
<strong><li>Implementation - </strong>Stick credit card number into internet form, send link to intern for setup.<br>  
<strong><li>Outcome - </strong>Necessary business intelligence doesn't magically appear on the fancy, built-in dashboard.<br> Feelings of anger and frustration over time and dollars wasted while Saturdays are spent reformatting the previous reporting spreadsheet.</li></p>  

<p><h4><strong>Why Does This Happen?</h4></strong><br>
Technology has changed the way business manages their most valuable asset - DATA. <br>
Compare to a technology implementation of ten years ago:
<strong><li>Managed by - </strong>Multidisciplinary committee including IT, process engineers, information systems analysts<br>
<strong><li>Sourcing Methodology - </strong>600 page request for proposal process over the span of 18 months with a minimum of three D&B vetted responses.<br>
<strong><li>Implementation - </strong> Analyze the business process, issue purchase order to Goldmine or Oracle with company specified terms and conditions, implement module and test, implement next module and test, port the data, provide 3-6 months of comprehensive user training led by a professional trainer in that software brand.<br> 
<strong><li>Outcome - </strong>Necessary business intelligence is generated on reports or sent to integrated systems when required and users understand how their actions contribute to the values appearing on those reports. The system works and the data is sound. Companies discover the data is so sound that 10 years later when they export it they have a robust "big data" set that can be queried or sold. </li><br><br>
Today, this type of implementation isn't feasible either. Business moves much faster and people expect solutions to be in place very quickly. Technology brands lead users to believe their system will work instantly, with the same level of robustness of these implementations past, out of the box with little or no expert support. You've probably already discovered that this isn't the case. </p>

Here, at The Empire Builders Group, we find that integrating a new piece of technology into the workflow of your business and making sure the information flows in properly so it comes out into an effective dashboard requires some careful attention. This is incredibly difficult to do when you have (another) day job and it's the first time you've seen this tool outside of it's packaging. We can help. </p>
