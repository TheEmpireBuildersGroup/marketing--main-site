##Technology has changed the way business works.

<strong>Ten years ago, no one would think about buying Goldmine or an Oracle</strong> product without convening a committee to discuss the data, legal and infrastructure needs. They’d create a functional specification and have a <strong>multidisciplinary team analyze the process, implement, port</strong> the data and provide comprehensive training to the users.

Today, most Vice Presidents of Sales place their credit card into the internet to buy some third party database and then ask an intern to set it up properly to store and process the <strong>MOST VALUABLE ASSET a company has – its DATA</strong>. Then, when it doesn’t work out, they have nowhere to turn. <strong>We make sure this doesn’t happen to you.</strong>
