    <h1 id="audit_twice,_build_once">Audit Twice, Build Once</h1>
    <p>Companies expect functional managers to figure out how to manage the process, accountant types to figure out how to manage the data and the IT department to manage the technology and all the other people involved will just figure it out. This doesn’t make a system, it generally makes a mess. Keep buying more software and getting more interns, you’re going to make a bigger mess. We know how to stop this cycle of struggle. We start with a process audit then we do a data audit, THEN we talk technology.</p>

        <h3>System Implementation</h3>
        <p>You need a new system, to expand your current system, to transition out of a legacy system or to merge your system with another. We understand what your goals are, what resources you already have in place and what already exists in your company. We examine your work flow, collect your data and help you select the best technology on the market for your specific need. Our team configures your system, brings in your data, completes the integrations, and formats the reports to your liking. We train your team on using the new system and processes and leave you with the resources you need to manage it on your own. </p>

        <h3>System Optimization</h3>
        <p>You have a system with data in it and it works fine or you don&#8217;t have the option to change it. We can help make using that system more effective and efficient. Some examples include: 1) transition to electronic workflows and processes - the paperless and paperlight offices. This includes support of Electronic Medical Record conversions. 2) integration of systems or combination of data sets for reporting 3) any complex dashboarding and analytics, especially if you can&#8217;t get or find the data in your existing technology. We identify where you&#8217;d like to be leaner or faster, work with or train your team to do the work if you prefer, provide business analysis or setup the systems, queries and reports that you need. </p>

        <h3>Company Technology Strategy</h3>
        <p>General Counsel won’t approve the Sugar CRM contract and you can’t even find a phone number to call their legal group. You moved hosting companies and now you can’t seem to access old email. The last company won’t help you. Your clients keep getting hacked and it makes you nervous because they only thing they share in common is you. There has to be a way to make all of these systems easier. Using excel to create our reporting is arduous and time consuming. The CEO heard Google Apps for Business was cheaper, the IT guy had some free Sharepoint licenses so you built a document library for production on it, your accountant insists you use a cloud based financial package and now the sales manager wants to buy Pipeliner. We help companies review their current technology architecture, spend, risk and licensing and support the renegotiation of contract terms with technology providers.  </p>

        <h3>Due Diligence of Companies and Technology</h3>
        <p>We are often requested during an audit, due diligence or valuation to provide our recommendations around the integrity, risk factors and potential value of a company's current data and technology. Our deliverables include any compliance or deal required documentation in industry acceptable formats. We then apply this expertise to helping our clients select the right technology vendors and technology solutions for their business. Your IT team can help determine if your server and your workstations are configured properly, but how much experience do they have in helping you make strategic vendor decisions? You speak in business needs; most technology companies speak in techie-ese. We help understand what your business requires and translate that into a functional specification. We can then define scopes of work for various vendors or providers, provide you a feature and benefit review of products and services on the market. </p>
