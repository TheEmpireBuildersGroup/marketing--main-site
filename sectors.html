<h1>Companies Need Information</h1>
<p>The types of companies that find our services most valuable are those undergoing some type of strategic change or those looking to improve their operational technology. </p>


<h2>Need Technology Improvement?</h2>
<div class="quote">
    <p><span class="large-type">&ldquo;</span> The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.<span class="large-type">&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="three-quarters">Companies who are seeking to improve their operational technology might be looking to put in a new CRM or practice management system want to know if we work in it. Perhaps the need is more general - they feel like they have many systems and no data. They oftentimes describe their experience of paying for many technology licenses but having to work very hard to get very mediocre reporting and they just wish it was easier. Even if they have a sales or marketing system in place, they are probably managing what information they do use in excel or email. They may have a system in the warehouse to track inventory but no one could figure out why it was counting oddly so they disabled most of the features and just give the week totals to accounting to key in. These companies have HR or purchasing departments that vet vendors and potential employees by collecting paper resumes and contracts and they spend a lot of time waiting for things to come back signed, approved or delivered. We help companies do business using technology more efficiently in the core processes of Sales, Marketing, Accounting, Product and Service Delivery, HR Management, Legal and Compliance.</p>

<h2>Undergoing Strategic Change?</h2>
<div class="quote">
    <p class="base-type"><span class="large-type">&ldquo;</span> We must bear in mind, that there is nothing more difficult and dangerous, or more doubtful of success, than an attempt to introduce a new order of things. For the innovator has for enemies all those who benefited from the old order of things, whilst those who will benefit by the new will be but lukewarm defenders.  This indifference arises from fear of adversaries who were favoured by the existing system and from the fact that men have no faith in anything new that is not the result of well-established experience.  Hence it is that, whenever there is an opportunity to attack the new order of things, they will do it with the zeal of partisans, whilst the others defend it but feebly.<span class="large-type">&rdquo;</span></p>
