    <h1 id="audit_twice,_build_once">Audit Twice, Build Once</h1>
    <p>Companies expect functional managers to figure out how to manage the process, accountant types to figure out how to manage the data and the IT department to manage the technology. Companies assume that all the people involved will just figure it out. This doesn’t make a system, it generally makes a mess. Keep buying more software and getting more interns, you’re going to make a bigger mess. We know how to unravel this ball of yarn. We start with a process audit, a data audit, THEN talk technology.</p>

        <h3>System Implementation</h3>
        <p>Your web design team does beautiful work, but there has to be a more effective way to get information out to our audience and collect viable leads. There has to be a way to make all of these systems easier. Using excel to create our reporting is arduous and time consuming.</p>

        <h3>Risk and Contract Management</h3>
        <p>General Counsel won’t approve the Sugar CRM contract and you can’t even find a phone number to call their legal group. You moved hosting companies and now you can’t seem to access old email. The last company won’t help you. Your clients keep getting hacked and it makes you nervous because they only thing they share in common is you.</p>

        <h3>Company Technology Strategy</h3>
        <p>The CEO heard Google Apps for Business was cheaper, the IT guy had some free Sharepoint licenses so you built a document library for production on it, your accountant insists you use a cloud based financial package and now the salesguy wants to buy Salesforce.</p>

            <p class="">Your IT team can help determine if your server and your workstations are configured properly, but how much experience do they have in helping you make strategic vendor decisions?</p>
            <p class="">You speak in business needs; most technology companies speak in techie-ese.</p>
            <p class="">Deliverables from due diligence include functional specifications for technology, business analysis for process use case, data corruption or normalization recommendations, possible query architecture for reporting dashboards, feature and benefit review of competitive products, deep dive product analysis to use case, vendor management recommendations and more.</p>
