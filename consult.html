        <h3>Process<br/>Optimization</h3>
        <p>We start by documenting what is actually happening in the business process you feel the pain, either Sales, Marketing, Finance, Product/Service Delivery, Human Resource Management, Legal, Risk or Compliance. Quickly and easily, you can see where your team can minimize cost and maximizing throughput and/or efficiency. It's a baselining step that gets everyone in the same understanding of what is occurring in the company today and where can harness the most gains with technology. This step is quick and after we're complete, executives are thankful we went through it because of how much they learned AND how much they realized they could have lost by implementing technology without knowing this first. </p>

        <h3>Data<br/>Analysis</h3>
        <p>We collect all the data sets you already have and those you didn't know you had. We work with you to get the data ready for the new system, whether that means creating a new numbering system for parts and re-tagging all the existing information, or brining very different data sets together or recovering lost or corrupted data from a previous system or a breach. We identify the type of reporting you want to achieve at the end of implementation and determine all the processing steps in the middle necessary to get the complex reporting and analysis you require for data driven business decisions as automatically as possible.</p>

        <h3>Technology<br/>Implementation</h3>
        <p>After everyone is clear how you're doing business and what data needs to come into the system and how, we work with your team to create a functional specification for what new system needs to be implemented, how the data will flow through the company (either through integrations or through people in the workflow), if systems need to be redeployed or if any custom development is required. We will help you understand what the technology can do for your business process so you get the most use out of your investment, configure it, set up the reporting, train the users and manage any technical vendors required before turning over the systems back to you, ready to use.</p>

    <h1 id="audit_twice,_build_once">Audit Twice, Build Once</h1>
    <p>Companies expect functional managers to figure out how to manage the process, accountant types to figure out how to manage the data and the IT department to manage the technology and all the other people involved will just figure it out. This doesn’t make a system, it generally makes a mess. Keep buying more software and getting more interns, you’re going to make a bigger mess. We know how to stop this cycle of struggle. We start with a process audit then we do a data audit, THEN we talk technology.</p>

        <h3>System Implementation</h3>
        <p>You need a new system, to expand your current system, to transition out of a legacy system or to merge your system with another. We understand what your goals are, what resources you already have in place and what already exists in your company. We examine your work flow, collect your data and help you select the best technology on the market for your specific need. Our team configures your system, brings in your data, completes the integrations, and formats the reports to your liking. We train your team on using the new system and processes and leave you with the resources you need to manage it on your own. </p>

        <h3>System Optimization</h3>
        <p>You have a system with data in it and it works fine or you don&#8217;t have the option to change it. We can help make using that system more effective and efficient. Some examples include: 1) transition to electronic workflows and processes - the paperless and paperlight offices. This includes support of Electronic Medical Record conversions. 2) integration of systems or combination of data sets for reporting 3) any complex dashboarding and analytics, especially if you can&#8217;t get or find the data in your existing technology. We identify where you&#8217;d like to be leaner or faster, work with or train your team to do the work if you prefer, provide business analysis or setup the systems, queries and reports that you need. </p>

        <h3>Company Technology Strategy</h3>
        <p>General Counsel won’t approve the Sugar CRM contract and you can’t even find a phone number to call their legal group. You moved hosting companies and now you can’t seem to access old email. The last company won’t help you. Your clients keep getting hacked and it makes you nervous because they only thing they share in common is you. There has to be a way to make all of these systems easier. Using excel to create our reporting is arduous and time consuming. The CEO heard Google Apps for Business was cheaper, the IT guy had some free Sharepoint licenses so you built a document library for production on it, your accountant insists you use a cloud based financial package and now the sales manager wants to buy Pipeliner. We help companies review their current technology architecture, spend, risk and licensing and support the renegotiation of contract terms with technology providers.  </p>

        <h3>Due Diligence of Companies and Technology</h3>
        <p>We are often requested during an audit, due diligence or valuation to provide our recommendations around the integrity, risk factors and potential value of a company's current data and technology. Our deliverables include any compliance or deal required documentation in industry acceptable formats. We then apply this expertise to helping our clients select the right technology vendors and technology solutions for their business. Your IT team can help determine if your server and your workstations are configured properly, but how much experience do they have in helping you make strategic vendor decisions? You speak in business needs; most technology companies speak in techie-ese. We help understand what your business requires and translate that into a functional specification. We can then define scopes of work for various vendors or providers, provide you a feature and benefit review of products and services on the market. </p>
