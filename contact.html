<section class="">
<h2 id="office_information">Office Information</h2>

<p>We are located in Philadelphia and we take meetings by appointment on Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 5:00pm ET.
We close for holidays observed by the US, the State of Pennsylvania and for some at our discretion. </p>

<p>Our phone number is <strong>1-800-599-0353</strong> and this number also accepts incoming faxes. 
We cannot send outgoing faxes and when requested to do so, we consider it a cry for help and respond with a proposal for services. </p>
