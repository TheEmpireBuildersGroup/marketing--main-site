<h2>It may sound like a joke,<br/> but it’s actually our secret sauce.</h2>
<p>Typically: The lawyer spends time managing revenue and risk. The technologist spends time understanding the data patterns and building the technology.</p>
<p>We thought….what if we could put these specialists together into one service offering so that the business workflow, data, and technology work in tandem for truly comprehensive risk controlled operations? That’s what we did.</p>

<h1>It sounds like a joke, but it isn't.</h1>
<p>We thought: What if we could put the people with expertise in business operations, compliance and risk into a service offering alongside the people with expertise building technology and managing data? We'd create the utopia that every Chief Executive Officer dreams about - the people who understood how the system worked and how it needed to be managed at a business level as one.</p>
