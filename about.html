<h1>It sounds like a joke, but it isn't.</h1>
<p>We thought: What if we could put the people with expertise in business operations, compliance and risk into a service offering alongside the people with expertise building technology and managing data? We'd create the utopia that every Chief Executive Officer dreams about - the people who understood how the system worked and how it needed to be managed at a business level as one.</p>

<h2>That's what we did.</h2>
