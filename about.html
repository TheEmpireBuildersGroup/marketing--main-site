<h2>It may sound like a joke,<br/> but it’s actually our secret sauce.</h2>
<p>Typically: The lawyer spends time managing revenue and risk. The technologist spends time understanding the data patterns and building the technology.</p>
<p>We thought….what if we could put these specialists together into one service offering so that the business workflow, data, and technology work in tandem for truly comprehensive risk controlled operations? That’s what we did.</p>
